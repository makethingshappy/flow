## Features
- **Versatile control:** Monitor analog and digital I/O channels.
- **Wireless connectivity:** Wi-Fi and standard MQTT protocol.
- **Easy integration:** Custom Node-RED nodes for quicker set up.
- **Dashboard examples:** Example flows for node-red are supplied for IoTextra Relay2, Input and Octal modules.
- **Standardised firmware:** Universal firmware driver can be used with any IoTextra module out of the box.
- **Simple configuration:** All 8 channels can be configured to be either input or output, as well as selecting interface type - iether I2C or GPIO (HOST connector) using a config file

## Hardware Requirements
- 1 x IoTbase Module
- 1 x IoTextra Module
- 1 x Microcontroller (ESP32-S3, PICO, PICO W, PICO 2W and etc)
- *(Optional)* Computer to run Node-RED or a dedicated device, e.g. Raspberry Pi 5

---

## Software Requirements
- **Thonny IDE** – for flashing firmware to Pico
- **Node-RED** – installed locally or on a Single Board Computer like Raspberry Pi
---

## Step 1: Hardware Setup
- Attach MCU to the IoTbase
- Connect power supply to the IoTbase via USB
- Connect USB to the MCU (for flashing the firmware)
- Connect IoTbase and IoTextra module via HOST connector

---

## Step 2: Flashing MicroPython Firmware (Example: PICO W)
1. Download the `firmware.uf2` file from MicroPython official website
Example: For PICO W - `https://micropython.org/download/RPI_PICO_W/`
2. Hold down BOOTSEL on the Pico W and connect it to your computer via micro-USB.
3. Release BOOTSEL – Pico will appear as a `RPI-RP2` drive.
4. Copy the `firmware.uf2` file to this drive.
5. Pico will reboot with the new firmware.

- Above applies for RPI PICO W board but you can find detailed guides for other microcontrollers that support MicroPython online.

## Step 3: Firmware Configuration
1. Connect Microcontroller to your computer.
2. Open Thonny IDE.
3. Select interpreter: MicroPython (Your Microcontroller).
4. Upload every .py file to the microcontroller. 
5. Open the `config.py` file and fill in the required details
6. Save the file (Ctrl+S). The device will restart and attempt to connect to the network.

## Step 4: Node-RED Installation
1. Install Node-RED (see the [official guide](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/)).
2. Install the dashboard:
   - Open Node-RED in your browser (`http://127.0.0.1:1880`)
   - Menu (top right) → Manage palette → Install
   - Search for `node-red-dashboard` and install
3. Install custom IoTextra nodes:
   - (Local installation example)
   - Go to your Node-RED user directory (e.g. `~/.node-red`)
   - Run:
     ```bash
     npm install /path/to/project/node-red-contrib-iotextra
     ```
   - Restart Node-RED

   - You should see two new custom nodes called "iotextra - input", "iotextra - analog", and "iotextra - output" in the "network" category (check the images -> iotextra-io-node-function-category.png)

---

## Step 5: Importing the Example Dashboard
1. Download the `node-red-examples` folder from the repository.
2. In Node-RED: Menu → Import → select the `[your_board_name]_flow.json` file → Import
3. Configure the MQTT broker address in the iotextra node if it differs from the default.
4. Click Deploy.
5. The dashboard will be available at: `http://<your-node-red-ip>:1880/ui`

## Step 6: How to use iotextra custom Node-RED nodes
- **IoTextra Output for a selected channel:**
  - Accepts an incoming msg.payload in the format of either true/false or 1/0
  - This uses a broker to send the command to the mezzanine device
  - The firmware writes the state of the received message payload to the corresponding channel (pin AP0-AP7)
  - Mezzanine device publishes an outgoing message payload confirming that state has been received and acknowledged
  - IoTextra Output Node-RED node is subcribed to the confirmation message topic and provides an outgoing msg.payload with either '1' or '0'
- **IoTextra Input for a selected channel:**
  - If a change in the state of the input channel (pin AP0-AP7) is detected on the physical mezzanine device by the firmware - it publishes the observed state of the input channel (1 or 0)
  - IoTextra Input Node-RED node listens for changes on the channel and provides an outgoing msg.payload ('1' or '0') corresponding to the state of the input channel

## How MQTT Protocol is used to send/receive data form the mezzanine 
- **Device status:**
  - `<MQTT_BASE_TOPIC>/status` – online/offline
- **Digital inputs:**
  - `<MQTT_BASE_TOPIC>/input/<channel>` – state of the input channel on the device 1 (ON) or 0 (OFF)
- **Digital outputs:**
  - `<MQTT_BASE_TOPIC>/output/<channel>/set` – used to toggle the state of the output channel on the device -> 1 (ON) or 0 (OFF)
  - `<MQTT_BASE_TOPIC>/output/<channel>/state` – used for confirming that the command has been received by the device and state has indeed changeed -> 1 (ON) or 0 (OFF)
- **Diagram:**
  - For visual representation of the above information you may view `mezzanine-interface-diagram.pdf` file in the documentation

## Troubleshooting
- **No connection to MQTT broker:**
  - Check MQTT_BROKER address and Wi-Fi credentials in `config.py`
  - Make sure the MQTT broker is running and accessible on the network
