## Software Requirements
- **Thonny IDE** – for flashing firmware to your microcontroller
- **Node-RED** – installed locally or on a Single Board Computer like Raspberry Pi

---

## Step 1: Hardware Setup
- Attach MCU to the IoTbase via header connectors
- Provide power to IoTbase via either connecting to USB slot of MCU or external supply
- Connect USB to the MCU (for flashing the firmware or using the IoTflow Forge Configuration Tool)
- Connect IoTbase and IoTextra module via HOST connector

## IoTsmart System-on-Module (SOM) Microcontrollers

Supported SOMs:

- IoTsmart ESP32-S3
- IoTsmart RP2040 or RP2350A
- IoTsmart XIAO (Coming Soon) — supports multiple XIAO-compatible SoMs

**Steps:**

1. **Normal Operation:** Insert the SOM into the **HOST connector slot** on the IoTbase or just connect it directly HOST connector of an IoTextra module.
2. **Firmware Flashing / Configuration:** Use the **IoTsmart adapter cable**.
3. **Power:** Connect USB to the IoTbase to supply power to the SOM and any attached modules.
4. **USB Connection (via adapter cable):** Required for flashing firmware, using the **IoTflow Forge Configuration Tool**, or serial debugging.

## IoTextra Mezzanine Modules

IoTextra modules (Analog, Combo, Digital, etc.) connect **directly to the HOST connector slot** on the IoTbase.

**Step:**

- Insert the IoTextra module into the HOST connector / header slot.  
  This provides power, I²C, and digital signals needed for the module to operate.

---

## Step 2: Flashing MicroPython Firmware (Example: PICO W)
1. Download the `firmware.uf2` file from MicroPython official website
Example: For PICO W - `https://micropython.org/download/RPI_PICO_W/`
2. Hold down BOOTSEL on the Pico W and connect it to your computer via micro-USB.
3. Release BOOTSEL – Pico will appear as a `RPI-RP2` drive.
4. Copy the `firmware.uf2` file to this drive.
5. Pico will reboot with the new firmware.

Above applies for RPI PICO W board but you can find detailed guides for other microcontrollers that support MicroPython via the offical `https://micropython.org` website.

---

## Step 3: Firmware Configuration (IoTflow Kernel)
1. **Connect your microcontroller** to your computer via USB.  
2. **Open an IDE of your choice** (e.g., Thonny, VS Code, or any IDE that supports MicroPython).  
3. **Select the interpreter** for your device:  
   - In your IDE, choose **MicroPython** and select your microcontroller.  
4. **Upload the main script**:  
   - Transfer `main.py` to the root directory of your microcontroller.  
5. **Upload supporting libraries**:  
   - Transfer all other `.py` files into a `lib` folder on the microcontroller.  
6. **Configure settings**:  
   - Open `config.py` on the microcontroller.  
   - Update it with your desired configuration (Wi-Fi credentials, device settings, etc.).  
   - Save the file (**Ctrl+S**).  
7. **Restart your device**:  
   - Reboot the microcontroller.  
   - It will automatically attempt to connect to the network using your configuration (Subject to providing correct credentials or details).

---

## Step 4: Utility Configuration I/O Tool (IoTflow Forge)
For more detailed information about IoTflow Forge please review [`IoTflow Forge/README.md`](../IoTflow%20Forge/README.md)

1. Connect your microcontroller to your computer.
2. Open `IoTflow Forge.py` and run the python program.
3. Make a new configuration or load a configuration.
4. Send your configuration to your microcontroller (via USB).
5. Await a few seconds for system response.
6. If configuration matches your desired setup you may disconnect 
from your computer and close the `IoTflow Forge.py` program.

---

## Step 5: Node-RED Installation
1. Install Node-RED (see the [official guide](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/)).
2. Install the dashboard:
   - Open Node-RED in your browser (`http://127.0.0.1:1880`)
   - Menu (top right) → Manage palette → Install
   - Search for `node-red-dashboard` and install
3. Install custom IoTextra nodes:
   - (Local installation example)
   - Go to your Node-RED user directory (e.g. `~/.node-red`)
   - Run:
     ```bash
     npm install /path/to/project/node-red-contrib-iotextra
     ```
   - Restart Node-RED

   - You should see two new custom nodes called "iotextra - input", "iotextra - analog", and "iotextra - output" in the "network" category (check the images -> iotextra-io-node-function-category.png)

---

## Step 6: Importing the Example Dashboard
1. Download the `node-red-examples` folder from the repository.
2. In Node-RED: Menu → Import → select the `[your_board_name]_flow.json` file → Import
3. Configure the MQTT broker address in the iotextra node if it differs from the default.
4. Click Deploy.
5. The dashboard will be available at: `http://<your-node-red-ip>:1880/ui`

## How to use iotextra custom Node-RED nodes
- **IoTextra Output for a selected channel:**
  - Accepts an incoming msg.payload in the format of either true/false or 1/0
  - This uses a broker to send the command to the mezzanine device
  - The firmware writes the state of the received message payload to the corresponding channel (pin AP0-AP7)
  - Mezzanine device publishes an outgoing message payload confirming that state has been received and acknowledged
  - IoTextra Output Node-RED node is subcribed to the confirmation message topic and provides an outgoing msg.payload with either '1' or '0'
- **IoTextra Input for a selected channel:**
  - If a change in the state of the input channel (pin AP0-AP7) is detected on the physical mezzanine device by the firmware - it publishes the observed state of the input channel (1 or 0)
  - IoTextra Input Node-RED node listens for changes on the channel and provides an outgoing msg.payload ('1' or '0') corresponding to the state of the input channel
- **IoTextra Analog for a selected channel:**
- The IoTextra Analog modules (Combo Included) continously detect differential ADC input channels (A0-A1, A2-A3) data on the physical mezzanine device by the firmware - it publishes the converted voltage or current from raw ADC data of the differential input channels sequentially
- User can change the firmware so that it only publishes data when the previous value has changed. (This includes some deadband filtering)
- IoTextra Analog Node-RED node listens for data on each channel and provides an outgoing string msg.payload ("3.124") corresponding to the differential input channel of an ADC
- If you are using multiple ADCs (for example, the IoT Extra Analog modules), the firmware processes them in the order of their I²C addresses. The array of I²C addresses determines the sequence: the first address in the list is treated as ADC 1, the second as ADC 2, and so on. Each ADC provides two differential input channels (A0–A1 and A2–A3). So with two ADCs, you effectively have:
  - ADC 1: Differential channels A0–A1 and A2–A3
  - ADC 2: Differential channels A0–A1 and A2–A3
- The firmware always reads from the lowest-indexed (first) I²C address first, then proceeds through the rest of the list.

## How MQTT Protocol is used to send/receive data from the IoTextra Modules 

The IoTextra modules communicate status, digital I/O, and analog readings via MQTT. The topics follow a structured format using `<MQTT_BASE_TOPIC>` as the root.  

| Category          | MQTT Topic                                      | Description                                                                                  | Values / Format          |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Device Status** | `<MQTT_BASE_TOPIC>/status`                     | Indicates whether the device is online or offline                                           | `online` / `offline`    |
| **Digital Input** | `<MQTT_BASE_TOPIC>/input/<channel>`           | State of a digital input channel                                                            | `1` (ON) / `0` (OFF)    |
| **Digital Output**| `<MQTT_BASE_TOPIC>/output/<channel>/set`      | Command to change the output state                                                          | `1` (ON) / `0` (OFF)    |
|                  | `<MQTT_BASE_TOPIC>/output/<channel>/state`    | Confirms the output state after command                                                     | `1` (ON) / `0` (OFF)    |
| **Analog Channel**| `<MQTT_BASE_TOPIC>/analog/<channel>`          | Current reading of an analog channel                                                       | Numeric string (e.g., `"3.142"`) |
|                  |                                                 | Unit is **V** (voltage) or **mA** (current) depending on channel configuration               | N/A                       |

- **Device status:**
  - `<MQTT_BASE_TOPIC>/status` – online/offline
  
  Example:
  `
  Topic: home/iotextra/status
  Payload: online
  `
- **Digital inputs:**
  - `<MQTT_BASE_TOPIC>/input/<channel>` – state of the input channel on the device 1 (ON) or 0 (OFF)
  
  Example:
  `
  Topic: home/iotextra/input/1
  Payload: 1          # ON
  `
- **Digital outputs:**
  - `<MQTT_BASE_TOPIC>/output/<channel>/set` – used to toggle the state of the output channel on the device -> 1 (ON) or 0 (OFF)
  
  Example:
  `
  Topic: home/iotextra/output/1/set
  Payload: 1          # Turn ON output channel 1
  `
  - `<MQTT_BASE_TOPIC>/output/<channel>/state` – used for confirming that the command has been received by the device and state has indeed changeed -> 1 (ON) or 0 (OFF)
  
  Example:
  `
  Topic: home/iotextra/output/1/state
  Payload: 1          # Confirms output channel 1 is ON
  `
- **Analog channels:**
  - `<MQTT_BASE_TOPIC>/analog/<channel>` – current reading of the analog channel, published as a string (e.g., "3.142")
  - Units are V (voltage) or mA (current), depending on channel configuration
  - Values are updated periodically or change if deadband filtering is enabled within the software (Commented by DEFAULT)
  
  Example: 
  `
  Topic: home/iotextra/analog/1
  Payload: "3.142"    # Analog channel 1 reading in volts or mA
  `

**Notes:**
- Analog and Digital input/output channels provide instantaneous state updates.  
- Ensure that `<MQTT_BASE_TOPIC>` matches your device configuration for correct topic mapping.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **No connection to MQTT broker:**
  - Check MQTT_BROKER details and Wi-Fi credentials in `config.py` or check your `.JSON` file from `IoTflow Forge.py`
  - Make sure the MQTT broker is running and accessible on the network
