# IoTflow: Workflow Engine for MQTT & Node-RED Automation

## Overview

IoTflow is a lightweight orchestration layer designed to unify automation workflows across the IoTextra-Digital modules and IoTsmart MCU boards.  
It provides structured Node-RED flow patterns, MQTT-friendly workflow organization, and a consistent method for synchronizing digital inputs, outputs, and automation logic across multiple devices.

IoTflow is not firmware and does not include device drivers — it is a **workflow framework** used to coordinate existing MQTT and Node-RED environments.

## Supported IIoT Workflows

IoTflow is optimized for:

- MQTT-based event automation  
- Digital I/O routing across IoTextra and IoTsmart devices  
- Input-to-event mappings for Node-RED  
- Multi-device orchestration workflows  
- Edge automation using Raspberry Pi, Linux gateways, and ESP32-S3 boards  
- Clean, scalable, repeatable automation patterns  

These workflows enable developers to assemble industrial or home-automation logic without complex manual configuration.

## Node-RED Flow Structure

This repository includes pre-built Node-RED flow files in the `/Node-RED Examples/` directory.

These flows demonstrate:

- MQTT topic processing  
- Digital input → event mapping  
- Digital output control logic  
- Routing between multiple devices  
- Trigger → action automations  
- Best-practice patterns for IoTextra + IoTsmart integration  

The flow files are ready to import directly into any Node-RED environment.

## MQTT Workflow Automation

IoTflow uses MQTT as its core messaging mechanism.

Features include:

- Clear and consistent topic naming  
- Event-driven digital input reporting  
- Structured command channels for outputs  
- Scalable multi-module workflows  
- Compatibility with Mosquitto, EMQX, Aedes, and other brokers  

This repository does **not** include MQTT client code — only the workflow structure used to organize automation logic.

## Event-Driven Automation Examples

Reference examples are located in:

```
/Node-RED Examples/
```

Included examples show:

- State-change automations  
- Timed and conditional logic  
- Multi-module IoTextra/IoTsmart routing  
- Notification and action chains  

These examples are **reference workflows**, not production applications.

## Installation & Quick Start

1. Install Node-RED on your Raspberry Pi, Linux host, or IoT gateway.  
2. Clone or download this repository.  
3. Open Node-RED → **Import** → Select a file from `/Node-RED Examples/`.  
4. Configure your MQTT broker details inside Node-RED.  
5. Deploy the flow to begin automation.

IoTflow is intentionally lightweight and adapts to any existing MQTT + Node-RED stack.
